This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(broom)
library(rpart)
library(randomForest)
# bring in data and inspect data
sk_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/EDA-Project/data/sKor_data_tot_v02.csv")

```
```{r}
#EDA

# initial Feature Engineering
#for continuous to numeric e.g the total energy consumption to num_of_households do boxplots

#for categorical data can utilise heat map to see relationship


```

```{r}
#seed split(train-test 70:30)

#train: 70 train: 30 validation
set.seed(100)
train <- sample(nrow(sk_df), 0.7*nrow(sk_df), replace = FALSE)
TrainSet <- sk_df[train,]
TestSet <- sk_df[-train,]


        
#basic Random Forest 

RFM <- randomForest(num_tot_energy_heat~., data=TrainSet)

# RFM_max <- randomForest(value_max ~ . -value_min, data = train_set, ntree = 100, mtry = 8, importance = TRUE)
# 
# 
# rmse <- function(actual, predicted){
#   mse <- mean((actual - predicted) ** 2)
#   return(sqrt(mse))
# }
# 

train_preds <- Trainset%>%
  transmute(
        time,
        actual = value_max,
        predicted_forest = predict(RFM_max, .))

#hyper parameters: ntree and mtry(number of features to do), add importance = TRUE


```
```{r}
#tuning hyper paraemeters es use(Caret) do gridsearch,for loop, random search


```
```{r}

```{r}

#ensure you discuss that random forest isnnot intutative.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
